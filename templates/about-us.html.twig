    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>
        Afterglow isn't just another festival; it's a celebration of the raw energy and melody that defines drum and
        bass. Born from a shared passion for syncopated rhythms and powerful basslines, our festival is the ultimate
        gathering for anyone who lives for this music.
    </p>
    <p>
        We created Afterglow with a clear vision: to build an experience where music and community intertwine. Every
        stage, every art installation, and every moment is designed to immerse you in a world where boundaries fade
        away. Our goal is to offer more than just a performanceâ€”we want to take you on a true sensory journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are a family of enthusiasts, from the artists and technicians to the festival-goers themselves. Afterglow is
        the result of our love for drum and bass in all its shades, from melancholic liquid to relentless neurofunk and
        euphoric jump up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Join us and be a part of the story. After the last beat fades, the afterglow remains.
